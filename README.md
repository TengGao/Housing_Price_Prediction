# Housing_Price_Prediction
This work is inspired by Lavanya Shukla's housing price prediction [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/lavanyashukla01/how-i-made-top-0-3-on-a-kaggle-competition). However, I will add my own EDA, and model selection steps. Also, I will add catboost regressor and use Kaz-Anova's StackNet for stacking.
