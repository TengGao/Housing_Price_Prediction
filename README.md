# Housing Price Prediction
This work is inspired by Lavanya Shukla's housing price prediction [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/lavanyashukla01/how-i-made-top-0-3-on-a-kaggle-competition). Since my prefer visualization tools are plotly, cufflinks, and plotly express, I will convert all of her EDA plots into the plotly stack, and add a few of plots of my own. 

I am also curious as how CatBoost can stack up to other algorithms, so I will add CatBoost into the models selection, as well as using sklearn's pipeline to streamline the preprocessing steps.

Lastly, I want to see how Kaz-Anova's StackNet can be applied to this problem and what the result will be, so I will rewrite the stacking part of the notebook.

This is a work in progress, so I will keep updating these notebooks for coming weeks.


**Note**: I may have used cufflinks subplot features, which, as of Jun 2019, has an incompatibility issue with plotly, and the fix had not been upload to PYPI yet. I change my own cufflinks source code following this [commit](https://github.com/santosjorge/cufflinks/pull/178/commits/cc4c23c2b45b870f6801d1cb0312948e1f73f424).
